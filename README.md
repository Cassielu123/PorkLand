# Pork Land

Bring Hamlet DLC from Don't Starve to Don't Starve Together

## To Clone

We're running out of quota for GitHub's Git Large File Storage, so lfs won't work, you need to set `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE` to 1 to skip it for clone to work

With PowerShell

```powershell
$env:GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1
```

With command prompt

```cmd
set GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1
```

With bash

```bash
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1
```
